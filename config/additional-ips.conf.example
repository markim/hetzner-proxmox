# Additional IP Configuration for Hetzner Proxmox Setup
# Copy this file to additional-ips.conf and configure your IPs
#
# Format: IP=address MAC=mac_address GATEWAY=gateway NETMASK=netmask
# 
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: MAC addresses are REQUIRED for Hetzner additional IPs!
# Without correct MAC addresses, traffic routing will fail!
#
# How to get MAC addresses from Hetzner:
# 1. Hetzner Cloud: Console → Project → Server → Networking → Additional IPs
# 2. Hetzner Robot: https://robot.hetzner.com → Server → IPs tab
# 3. Contact Hetzner support if MAC addresses aren't visible
#
# Example configuration (replace with your actual values from Hetzner):

IP=203.0.113.10 MAC=00:50:56:00:01:02 GATEWAY=203.0.113.1 NETMASK=255.255.255.192
IP=203.0.113.11 MAC=00:50:56:00:01:03 GATEWAY=203.0.113.1 NETMASK=255.255.255.192
IP=203.0.113.12 MAC=00:50:56:00:01:04 GATEWAY=203.0.113.1 NETMASK=255.255.255.192

# Add more IPs as needed following the same format
# Each line must include IP, MAC, GATEWAY, and NETMASK
#
# After configuration:
# 1. Run: ./install.sh --check-mac (to verify configuration)
# 2. Run: ./install.sh --network (to apply network setup)
#
# Notes:
# - Each IP should be on its own line
