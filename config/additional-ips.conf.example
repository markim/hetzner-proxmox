# Additional IP Configuration for Hetzner Proxmox Setup
# Copy this file to additional-ips.conf and configure your IPs
#
# Format: IP=address MAC=mac_address GATEWAY=gateway NETMASK=netmask
# 
# IMPORTANT: MAC addresses are REQUIRED for Hetzner additional IPs
# Without correct MAC addresses, traffic routing will fail!
#
# How to get MAC addresses from Hetzner:
# 1. Log into Hetzner Cloud Console or Robot
# 2. Navigate to your server's network configuration
# 3. Each additional IP should have an associated MAC address
# 4. If no MAC address is shown, contact Hetzner support
#
# Notes:
# - Each IP should be on its own line
# - MAC address format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (colon-separated)
# - Comments start with #
# - Empty lines are ignored

# Your IP configurations (uncomment and modify as needed):
# IP=YOUR_IP_1 MAC=YOUR_MAC_1 GATEWAY=YOUR_GATEWAY_1 NETMASK=255.255.255.192
# IP=YOUR_IP_2 MAC=YOUR_MAC_2 GATEWAY=YOUR_GATEWAY_2 NETMASK=255.255.255.192

# Example configuration:
# IP=203.0.113.10 MAC=00:50:56:00:01:02 GATEWAY=203.0.113.1 NETMASK=255.255.255.192
# IP=203.0.113.11 MAC=00:50:56:00:01:03 GATEWAY=203.0.113.1 NETMASK=255.255.255.192
